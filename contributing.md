# Contributing Guidelines

##  Protected Branch Policy

To maintain code quality and team collaboration, **no one is allowed to commit directly to the `main` branch**.

###  How to Contribute Code

**Create a feature branch**
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

**Commit and push your changes**

git push origin feature/your-feature-name

**Open a Pull Request (PR)**

    Title: Clear and descriptive
    
    Description: What youâ€™ve changed, why, and any screenshots or references
    
    Tag a team member for review

**Wait for review and approval**

Only after a team member reviews and approves, the PR can be merged.
